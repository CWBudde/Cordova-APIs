# Cordova-APIs
DWScript API headers for various Cordova plugins

## How to use
The API files can be used in conjunction with a DWScript JSCodeGen based compiler (such as Smart Mobile Studio). They are meant to access the API of Cordova plugins without using JavaScript directly, but from a higher level Pascal language level.
